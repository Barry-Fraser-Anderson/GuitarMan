# GuitarMan

An MVC exercise.

Sorting by Artist or Title is supported.
Clicking on the 'link' button open the link in another window.

It is still a 'work-in-progress'.
In particular, I intend to add extra sections for music theory, chords, tips etc.

## Description

A bookmarks manager using C# ASP.NET MVC.

I wrote this as I found that my browser bookmarks 'Music' folder was becoming tricky to navigate.

I am already finding it useful.
